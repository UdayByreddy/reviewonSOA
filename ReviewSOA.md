# Report: Investigating Service-Oriented Architecture for Performance and Scaling

**Introduction:** 
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a design pattern where different services communicate with each other over a network. Each service performs a specific task and is loosely coupled, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.

**Benefits of SOA:**
1. **Scalability:** Each Service can be scaled independently based on its demand.

2. **Fault Tolerance:** If one Service fails, it does not necessarily bring down the entrie system.

**Potential Use Cases for Our Project:**

1. Decomposing our monolithic application into smaller,independent services.

2. Use message Broker for communication between the communication.
