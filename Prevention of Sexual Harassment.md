# Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH)
A significant legislative and workplace framework called the ***Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH)*** was created to shield people from sexual harassment in work environments. The fundamental source of the idea is the Indian POSH Act, 2013, sometimes referred to as the "Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act."

### Main Features of POSH:

 1) ***Act's Scope***: The POSH Act covers all employees in public and private enterprises, regardless of their position, status, or rank. Although the act   focuses  on protecting women in the workplace, it is not just for them because many companies provide comparable rights to people of all genders.

 2) ***What Qualifies as Sexual Harassment:*** Any unwanted sexually suggestive behavior, whether expressed orally or nonverbally, such as:

     - Unwelcome approaches and pleas for sex

     - Exhibition of sexually explicit content; offensive words, phrases, or body language

     -   Invasion of personal space or unwanted physical contact
    
3) ***Internal accusations Committee (ICC):*** To handle and settle sexual harassment accusations, any company with more than ten employees is required by the POSH 

   Act to establish an ICC. The ICC is in charge of carrying out an impartial investigation and making suggestions to the employer.

4) ***The obligations of employers:***
    - establishing a secure workplace

    - putting in place a precise POSH policy

    - putting on frequent awareness and training campaigns

    - creating an ICC-based grievance redressal process
    
    - Taking appropriate action against offenders, such as firing them or filing a lawsui

5) ***Procedure for Filing a Complaint:*** Within three months of the incident, a victim of sexual harassment may submit a written complaint to the ICC. After conducting an investigation, the committee reports its findings and makes suggestions to the employer, who then has to implement them.
