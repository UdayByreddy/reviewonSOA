# Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH)
A significant legislative and workplace framework called the ***Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH)*** was created to shield people from sexual harassment in work environments. The fundamental source of the idea is the Indian POSH Act, 2013, sometimes referred to as the "Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act."

### Main Features of POSH:

 1) ***Act's Scope***: The POSH Act covers all employees in public and private enterprises, regardless of their position, status, or rank. Although the act   focuses  on protecting women in the workplace, it is not just for them because many companies provide comparable rights to people of all genders.

 2) ***What Qualifies as Sexual Harassment:*** Any unwanted sexually suggestive behavior, whether expressed orally or nonverbally, such as:

     - Unwelcome approaches and pleas for sex

     - Exhibition of sexually explicit content; offensive words, phrases, or body language

     -   Invasion of personal space or unwanted physical contact
    
3) ***Internal accusations Committee (ICC):*** To handle and settle sexual harassment accusations, any company with more than ten employees is required by the POSH 

   Act to establish an ICC. The ICC is in charge of carrying out an impartial investigation and making suggestions to the employer.

### What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

 There are three main categories of conduct that might lead to sexual harassment:

1) ***Unwelcome Physical Behavior:*** This comprises physical advances that are sexual in character and that the recipient finds offensive, such as improper patting, pinching, or touching.

2)  ***Sexually Suggestive Remarks or Comments:*** Any verbal abuse that causes discomfort to a person, such as offensive jokes, remarks, or inquiries concerning their looks, personal lives, or sexual preferences.

3) Explicit or inappropriate content display refers to the sharing or displaying of objectionable content, including sexually explicit photographs, videos, or messages, both offline and online (emails, social media, etc.).

### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour? 

In the event that I experience or witness sexual harassment, I would do the following:

1) ***Record the occurrence:*** I would make a note of the occurrence (or incidents), including the dates, times, locations, actions taken, and identities of any witnesses. This paperwork may be essential for reporting and substantiating the harassment.

2) ***Report to the Appropriate Authority:*** In accordance with my employer's POSH policy, I would file a formal report of the occurrence right away with the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) or the human resources (HR) department at work. For the issue to be handled professionally, formal reporting processes must be followed.

### Managing Harassment Cases

***Report the Event:***

     ***To the Committee for Internal Complaints (ICC):*** Inform the ICC or HR division about the harassment, including all relevant details and supporting documentation. It is their duty to carry out an official investigation and take necessary measures.

      ***To a Manager or Supervisor:*** You can first approach a dependable manager or supervisor who can help you with the procedure if you feel uneasy reporting straight to the ICC.
